What we can tell from looking and running the script. We know:

debugging copy.ps1
$computername @(localhost,ILCSDC0)

first time through foreach: 
$computer = localhost

$disk contains a disk object for a hard disk. 

if $disk less than 20%

$disk has a freespace and space property

if machine isn't 20 or less it won't run. Changed to diskpace less than 100% so you can get output.
